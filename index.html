                    Darts or dart-throwing is a competitive sport in which two or more players bare-handedly throw small sharp-pointed missiles known as darts at a round target known as a dartboard. Darts players are sometimes termed "dartists".<br><br>
                    Points can be scored by hitting specific marked areas of the board, though unlike in sports such as archery, these areas are distributed all across the board and do not follow a principle of points increasing towards the centre of the board. 
                    Though a number of similar games using various boards and rules exist, the term "darts" usually now refers to a standardised game involving a specific board design and set of rules.<br><br>
                    While being a professional shooting sport, darts is also a traditional pub game. Darts is commonly played in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, and recreationally enjoyed across the world.

                <p class="origins">
                    Much is speculated but if rumor holds true, the game of darts had its origin during the reign of King Henry VIII of England. It is believed that he told his archers to practice their arching skills all year round so they would be sharp and ready for battle at any time.
                    While practicing outside some archers, instead of shooting, started throwing their arrows as a means of fun. Maybe the thinking was, “anyone can shoot accurately lets see who can throw accurately”.
                    Needless to say, everyone knows England’s unfavorable weather, and it wasn’t long before this outdoor past-time or game was taken indoors to the comfort of the local pub. To handle the arrows better and make the game easier to play while indoors, the arrows were shortened.
                    The bottom of an overturned wine or ale (beer) barrel was used as a “target”. An interesting fact about the word “target”. The bottom of a wine / beer barrel was called a “butt”, which originated via archery from the French word “butte”, meaning “target”.
